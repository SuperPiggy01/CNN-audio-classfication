# ML: Audio classification by Convolutional neural network (CNN) model
The project achieves 3 gaol:

1. Transformed sound signal to time-frequency representation (MelSpectrogram) by Torchaudio
2. Created a 4-layer CNN module with 98% accuracy above
3. Trained only 36% of dataset but work for entire datasets 

Result:
